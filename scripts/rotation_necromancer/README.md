# Necromancer Rotation - Enhanced Edition

## Version 2.0 - Build Profiles + Equipped Skills

This enhanced version of the Necromancer rotation plugin adds two major features inspired by the Sorcerer build structure:

### New Features

#### 1. Build Profiles
Select from pre-configured build profiles that enable only relevant spells for specific playstyles:

- **Default**: All skills enabled based on individual menu settings (backward compatible)
- **Bone Spear**: Bone Spear focused build with supporting skills
- **Blood**: Blood magic focused build (Blood Lance, Blood Surge, Blood Wave, etc.)
- **Minion**: Minion master build focused on summoning and supporting minions

**How to use:**
1. Open the plugin menu
2. Select your desired build from the "Build Profile" dropdown
3. The rotation will automatically filter spells based on the selected profile

#### 2. Equipped Skills Detection
Automatic detection of skills on your skill bar - only spells equipped will be cast during rotation.

**How it works:**
1. The plugin automatically detects your equipped spells from the skill bar
2. Only spells that are equipped will be cast during rotation
3. No manual configuration needed - it's always active

**Menu Organization:**
- **Equipped Skills** section: Shows all skills currently on your skill bar
- **Ultra Instinct** section: Shows all skills NOT on your skill bar
- This keeps the menu organized and helps you see at a glance which skills are active

### Features Combined
Both features work together:
- Select a build profile to focus on a specific playstyle
- Equipped skills detection ensures only your equipped abilities are used
- Menu is automatically organized based on your skill bar
- Individual spell settings in the menu still apply for fine-tuning

### Backward Compatibility
- Uses the "Default" profile by default, maintaining original behavior
- All existing spell configurations are preserved
- No changes required to existing spell modules

### Technical Implementation
Following the Sorcerer rotation structure:

1. **equipped_skills.lua**: Module for detecting and managing equipped skills
   - Auto-detects spells on skill bar using `get_equipped_spell_ids()`
   - Maps spell IDs to module names
   - Provides filtering functions

2. **build_profiles.lua**: Module for managing build profiles
   - Defines multiple build configurations
   - Provides profile selection and filtering
   - Menu integration for profile selection

3. **main.lua**: Enhanced with filtering logic
   - `should_use_spell()` helper function checks both filters
   - All spell calls updated to respect filters
   - Cleaner structure inspired by Sorcerer rotation
